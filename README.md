- 👨‍💻 Hi, my name is Italo braga and I'm a computer engineer who is studying at UnB (University of Brasília)
  
- 👯 Right now, I'm studying machine learning and mobile development

- 💬 Ask me about anything you want (except Gojo's death. That still hits me hard)

- ⚡ Fun fact: One time I was walking down the street and then I saw a little kitten with anemia, so I took him and now he's my copilot when I'm coding
